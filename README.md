This DNA sonification project uses the fact that the amino acids synthesized by DNA are molecularly very close to neurotransmitters and therefore, most codons have definitive emotions associated with them. 
Since music is also known to affect emotion, the goal of this project is to find an 'objective' musical analogue to a given DNA chain using emotions as the 'key' to decode them. 
The hope is that by encoding dna into musical form, AIs trained on existing music can make contributions to DNA synthesis, where foreseeing the effects of a dna sequence in vivo is still a hard problem.
Although amino acids and therefore DNA have specific emotional associations as per the chart below, musical effects on emotion are generally accepted to be more subjective and context-dependent. 
Any collaborator with a strong understanding of music theory could therefore make great contributions to this project by adjusting the musical analogies of the 64 codons.
